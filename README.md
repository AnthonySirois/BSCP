# BSCP - Big Slap Containment Protocol

BSCP adds some ways to make an encounter with a Big Slap monster survivable. (Big Slap is also known as Giant or Titan).

Currently, this includes:

1. Slowing down the movement speed and sprint speed
2. Warning the players when a Big Slap spawn using its roar & forcing it to stand still for a certain amount of time, which should give players some time to run toward the diving bell
